# Medical Store Management System

#Overview

The Medical Store Management System is a comprehensive Java EE application designed to streamline the management of medical store operations. The project employs JDBC, JSP, and Java Beans to create a robust system that follows the 
MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern, promoting separation of concerns, ease of maintenance, and scalability.

Features

Create: Add new medicines and supplies to the inventory with all relevant details such as name, quantity, price, and expiry date.
Read: Search for medicines by name, category, or ID to quickly retrieve information.
Update: Modify existing records to ensure that information is accurate and up-to-date.
Delete: Remove obsolete or expired records from the system to maintain data integrity.

Database Connectivity: 
 Utilizes JDBC for seamless connection to a relational database (e.g., MySQL) to store and retrieve data efficiently.

  User-Friendly Interface: 
  Built with a clean and intuitive interface that allows users to navigate easily through the application.

  Search Functionality: 
  Allows users to quickly find medicines based on various criteria, improving efficiency in inventory management.

 Technologies Used
Java EE: Utilizing JDBC, JSP, and Java Beans for backend development.
  MVC Design Pattern: 
  Model: Represents the data and business logic. It is responsible for retrieving data from the database and processing it.
  View: Represents the user interface. It displays data to the user and sends user commands to the controller.
  Controller: Acts as an intermediary between Model and View. It processes user input and updates the model and view accordingly.
  Database: MySQL (or any other database you used).
  Development Tools: IDE (e.g., Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA), Apache Tomcat (for deployment).
